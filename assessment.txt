Pattern: 

	I noticed that the doubler insert takes significantly longer than the doublerAppend. I believe this has to do with the fact that the doublerInsert is not just adding the value, but inserting it into the array, causing the loop to run again.

	The doublerAppend functions scales better than the doublerInsert function. You can tell by the amount of time it takes to process as the arrays get larger. doubleAssert time scales up significantly compared to doubleAppend


Time Complexity:

doublerInsert - O(n^2)
doublerAppend - O(n)
